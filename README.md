# ðŸ§¢ Stupid Coaching

My first rails app built with Le Wagon.

If the message is I am going to work, the coach will answer Great! <br>
If the message has a question mark ? at the end, the coach will answer Silly question, get dressed and go to work!. <br>
Otherwise the coach will answer I don't care, get dressed and go to work! <br>
